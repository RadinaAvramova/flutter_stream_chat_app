# Flutter Chat App using Stream

This is a sample application using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Stream](https://getstream.io/) to easily build a chat application.

## Getting Started

In the `chat_service.dart` file you will need to configure the application with your API key, that can be obtained from the [Stream dashboard](https://getstream.io/). The API key used in this repository may no longer be active by the time you read this.
